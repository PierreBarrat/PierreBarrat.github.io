I am a quantitative biologist / physicist currently working at the University of Basel. I am broadly interested in finding models that give a *quantitative* description and understanding of biological phenomena, usually (but not only) using tools from statistical physics. 

## Current interests

I am currently focusing on the evolution of the seasonal influenza viruses. The first question is to understand how predictible this evolution is. This is of course motivated by the public healthcare challenge of finding a vaccine, but also by more fundamental questions: are the models commonly used in evolutionary biology a good description of a virus such as influenza?  
My second interest in that matter is to study the genetic reassortment events in influenza's genome. During co-infection of a cell by two distinct viruses, an exchange of genes is possible between the viruses, which can be seen as a form of sexual reproduction. This implies that while the evolutionary history of a single influenza gene is described by a tree, the history of a full genome has to be described by a graph (*i.e.* a genome can potentially have two parents), called the Ancestral Recombination Graph (ARG). We do not know the influence of reassortments on the evolution of the virus, in large parts because there are currently no efficient method to infer ARGs from sequence data. My goal is to design such a method and use it to gain a quantitative understanding of genetic reassortment.
