I am a quantitative biologist / physicist working at the Politecnico di Torino, in the [Statistical Physics and Interdisciplinary Applications team](https://www.disat.polito.it/research/research_groups/cmpcs/statistical_physics_and_interdisciplinary_applications). I am broadly interested in finding models that give a *quantitative* description and understanding of biological phenomena, usually (but not only) using tools from statistical physics. 

## Interests
### Evolution of influenza 
- How predictable is the evolution of seasonal influenza viruses? What determines the fate of variants? 
- Gene reassortment in influenza. During co-infection of a cell by two distinct viruses, an exchange of genes is possible. This means that while the evolutionary history of a single influenza gene is described by a tree, the history of a full genome has to be described by a graph (*i.e.* a genome can potentially have two parents), called the Ancestral Recombination Graph (ARG). 
  Can we infer this ARG? How important is gene reassortment to the evolution of influenza? 

### Protein sequence models
During my PhD in the team of [Martin Weigt](http://www.lcqb.upmc.fr/StatGenomicsBiolPhys), I worked on statistical models of homologous protein sequences(the so-called [DCA method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_coupling_analysis)).
